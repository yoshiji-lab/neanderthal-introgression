# Here is what I did to calculate average local recombination for a specific region (I created a region.bed):

# As a sanity check, you may want to see if the region reported in Hugoâ€™s paper (need to convert to hg38) has a recombination rate close to 0.526

# Hugo region (hg19): chromosome 3: 45859651 to 45909024 
# Converted to hg38: chromosome 3: 45818159 to 45867532  <------------------
